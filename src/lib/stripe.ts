 * Server-only Stripe client. The secret key comes from STRIPE_SECRET_KEY in the
 * environment (kept in .env / Vercel — never in the DB or admin UI).
 * Returns null when no key is configured (card payments disabled).
 * Never import into a client component.
 *
 * The API version is deliberately NOT passed: stripe-node pins its own version
 * (see node_modules/stripe/cjs/apiVersion.js), so the wire format always matches
 * the typings that ship with the installed SDK. Upgrade the version by upgrading
 * the package, not by hand-editing a date string here.
